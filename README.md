# Adventure-Works-Report
This report is a showcase of the understanding and use of the knowledge acquired from the Maven Analytics Power BI Courses!
This includes the use of Power Query, Data Modeling, Dax Functions, Calculations, Tables and New Columns creations,  and Advanced Visualization Techniques.

It consists of two pages: "Exec Summary" and "Product Detail". The report allows the user to analyze the sales, orders and return data by Product Name, Category or Subcategory. Also, It is possible to check the details of the performance of each Product by using the drill through filter (At the "Exec Summary" page, go to the matrix table and right click on the name of the product you want to see and select drill through > Product Detail). 

The report can be accessed through the following link (or you can also find the original Power BI file in this repository):
